## Robot Care

### Turning the robot on

To turn the robot on, flick the switch on the power bank to ON. The red light on the Raspberry Pi should turn on.

### Turning the robot off

To turn the robot off, first type `sudo shutdown now` in the terminal of the robot. This will shut down the Raspberry Pi. Once the lidar stops spinning, flick the switch on the power bank to OFF.

### Robot battery care

- **Charging the batteries:** Plug the battery into the power supply and switch the battery to ON for charging. The power adapter will have a red light while charging, and it will turn green when done. Switch the battery to OFF for storage.
- Always plug in uncharged batteries right away as they take a long time to charge.
- When a battery has three out of five green lights on, it should be replaced.

**Tip:** When you aren't using the Lidar, unplug the Micro USB cord from its board to disconnect it from the Raspberry Pi. When it spins, it draws a lot of power and drains the battery quickly.
