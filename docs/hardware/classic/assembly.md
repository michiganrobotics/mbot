## Soldering Encoder

| Components      |# |
|:--------------- |:-|
| Motor           |2 |
| Encoder         |2 |
| Magnets         |2 |

First, before assembling all the parts, you need to solder the encoder to the motor, as demonstrated in the 2nd image below. The 3rd image displays the soldering result, and the 4th image shows the magnet's placement. Please note that you should avoid positioning the magnet too close to the encoder or too far away, maintain a reasonable gap.

## Bottom Assembly
1. Mount the caster to the bottom

    | Components               |# |
    |:-----------------------  |:-|
    | Metal ball               |1 |
    | Bottom Acrylic Sheet     |1 |
    | 1/8" spacer              |1 |
    | 1/16" spacer             |1 |
    | M2 hex nuts              |2 |
    | M2 x 12mm screw          |2 |
    | Caster housing           |1 |


    Gather all required components and assemble them as depicted in the images below. You're not supposed to use the screws that come with the caster. Instead, search for M2 x 12mm screws to put it all together. You need to stack both spacers one on top of another during your assembly in order to match the height of the wheels.

    </div>

5. Put the wheels on

    | Components               |# |
    |:-----------------------  |:-|
    | Scooter Wheels 84 X 24 mm  |2 |
    | M3x20mm screws |6|
    | Wheel adapter  |2|
    | Set screws     |2|
    | Hex Key        |1|

    Note that we will not use the M3x14mm screws that came with the wheel adaptor, as they are not long enough, instead we are going to use M3x20mm screws here.

    <a class="image-link" href="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/assemblewheel_parts.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/assemblewheel_parts.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:300px;"/>
    </a>

    Follow the steps below:
    1. First, press fit the machined wheel adaptor into one side of the wheels, ensuring a part of it sticks out.
    2. Then press fit the flat metal piece into the opposite side, aligning the three holes.
    3. Insert the M3x20mm screws to secure the parts together, as demonstrated in the second image.
    4. Using the 2mm Hex wrench screw the set screws that come with the wheel adaptor kit into the wheel adaptors as shown in the 3rd and 4th image.

    <a class="image-link" href="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/assemblewheel.jpg">
        <img src="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/assemblewheel.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:500px;"/>
    </a>

    Then you can directly put the wheel on, use the hex key to tight the wheels. Note that it is necessary to leave a bit of space between the wheel and the screw head of the motor, as depicted in the image below, otherwise the wheel hub will rub against the screws holding the motor causing excess friction or jamming the motors.

        </div>


7. Connect the wires to Robotics Control Board.  The rainbow cables have the following signals:

    | Wire Color   | Signal     |
    |:-------------|:-----------|
    | Red          | Encoder B  |
    | Orange       | Encoder A  |
    | Yellow       | 3.3 V    |
    | Green        | GND    |
    | Blue         | Motor-    |
    | Black       | Motor+    |

    1. Examine the pins. In the case illustrated in the image, both the left and right motor have the green wire connected to the GND pin. We will use this info to connect to the Robotics Control Board.

        <a class="image-link" href="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/connectwire1.jpg">
        <img src="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/connectwire1.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:400px;"/>
        </a>
    2. Thread the wires through the bottom plate, following the configuration in the image below, ensuring they won't interfere with the encoder's magnet.
    3. Identify the GND pin on the Robotics Control Board and connect the wires to it accordingly. In this case, the green wire is connected to the GND pin. Note that you should connect the left wheel to M0 slot, right wheel to M1 slot as shown in the image.

        <a class="image-link" href="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/connectwire2.jpg">
        <img src="/assets/images/hardware/classic/bottomPlate/connectwire2.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:300px;"/>
